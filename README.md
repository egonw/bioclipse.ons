# Open Noteboek Science Solubility Project

This is the software repository for the Open Notebook Science Challenge (more information at
http://onschallenge.wikispaces.com/ ). The first round of this challenge calls upon groups or
individuals with access to materials and equipment to measure the solubility of compounds 
(aldehydes, amines and carboxylic acids are a priority) in organic solvents and report their
findings using Open Notebook Science. For more information on Open Notebook Science see the
Wikipedia page and Jean-Claude Bradley's original coining of the term 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Notebook_Science and
http://drexel-coas-elearning.blogspot.com/2006/09/open-notebook-science.html respectively)

This repository contains the code that is used to extract the data in RDF 
(http://anybody.cephb.fr/perso/lindenb/tmp/jcbradley.rdf ) from the primary record Google
Spreadsheet  (http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=plwwufp30hfq0udnEmRD1aQ) as well as that
used to generate a visualisation of the results via the Google API
(http://rguha.ath.cx/~rguha/cicc/jcsol/sol.html).
